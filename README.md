# Steam Nickname Changer
Reversed steam a little bit just to have some fun. Then i made this simple tool.

# Doesn't work?
Run steam as normal instead of admin. So if it runs 32bit steam. Then it may work. If it still doesn't work, then maybe it's because of wrong pointers. I don't think it will stable forever so. Try to have some fun until steam patch it / changes offsets.

# Have fun!
