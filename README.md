# Steam Nickname Changer
Reversed steam a little bit just to have some fun. Then i made this simple tool.

# Doesn't work?
Run steam as normal instead of admin. So if it runs 32bit steam, then it may work. If it still doesn't work, then maybe it's because of wrong pointers. I don't think it will stable forever so. Try to have some fun until steam patch it / changes offsets.

# Update
First offset which is 0x4FC, 0x52C, 0x55C changed to 0x58C <br />
Latest update: 26.11.2022

# Note
Since most of the people don't know how to update, i'll keep the project updated for a while.

# Have fun!
